                            <b>Task</b>: The AI system processes loan applications and generates approval recommendations. The recommendation is reviewed by one or more credit officers. The number of human reviewers depends on the size of the loan request, small loans may be reviewed by a single officer, while larger applications require the approval of multiple officers. These officers retain total authority to accept or reject the system recommended application result.
                            <br> <br>
                            <b>Intent</b>: The main intent behind the AI is to support credit officers and increase efficiency in the lending process.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Risks</b>: There are potential fairness risks if the system embeds bias from historic data. Transparency on how recommendations are generated is critical. Over reliance on the systems output could reduce critical evaluation by officers, especially for borderline applications.

                                <i>Process</i>: The AI system generates an approval recommendation for the application and feature importance scores which show how much each input feature influenced the systemâ€™s output. <br>
                                <i>Output</i>: One or more credit officers review the AI's recommendation. The loan will ultimately be approved or denied, depending on the agreement of the credit officers with the AI recommendation.

The users often use the AI system multiple times to check-in on their mobility and physical health overtime.

                            <i>Input</i>: The user completes 12 exercises while being video recorded under the supervision of a human physiotherapist for safety. The video of the user is fed into an already trained AI model 1. <br>
                            <i>Process</i>: The AI model 1 outputs the user's skeleton tracked from the skeleton video using deep learning and computer vision technology. An AI system handler reviews the skeleton video and decides if it is usable or if the user needs to re-complete the exercises in a new video. If the skeleton video is approved of, an already-trained AI model 2, a rule-based system, takes the skeleton video as input. <br>
                            <i>Output</i>: Then, the AI model 2 outputs a PDF report for the user.
